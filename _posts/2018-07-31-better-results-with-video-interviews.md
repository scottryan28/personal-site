More teams have embraced the concept of the video interview as an essential tool for screening applicants as well as determining overall fit within their organization. I've seen many interviewers commit mistakes during a live video session that they would never make in person. It's all too easy to forget that the camera is a two-way communication tool and that every fidget, eye roll, and chair spin is seen on the other side. Also, in my opinion a video session isn't an excuse for relaxed dress. I sat in a interview the other day where one of the interviewers appeared to be wearing an undershirt. Consider your background as well. A distracting, or cluttered office will not speak well of you.

You get to choose how you are portrayed. Do you want to portray a background of a bookshelf filled with technology books and your degrees/certifications

Are you communicating the company's culture and work environment? I'll admit to getting exciting when I see a office that looks like an energetic place to work with high levels of collaboration vs the bland looking closet disguised as a conference room.

My five key hints for video interviews:

Be present and be focused! Avoid distractions. Make sure you're looking at the person you're speaking with. Without making it creepy, try to make eye contact and connect just like you would in a normal face to face.

Be mindful of your camera angle. It's just like the selfie rule. I prefer to go when it comes to the video camera. Unfortunately, most laptops have their camera coming up under my chin (which is not a flattering angle for myself). I will usually boost my laptop on a stack of books.

Try standing. Me personally, I do my best communicating on my feet and not seated. I know I come across as a lot more authentic and compelling when I'm standing. I also have a tendency to slouch over my keyboard so standing removes that.

Practice! Don't go in cold to a video interview. Do a practice run or five and watch yourself. It's easy enough to record yourself as you go over your work history and/or describe a company culture.

And last, Look the part. Do not slack when it comes to the dress code and grooming.
